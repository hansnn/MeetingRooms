# MeetingRooms
Overview of meeting rooms

This is a website that I developed while working at Trondheim municipality, Norway, as an apprentice.
It is used to update and showcase an overview of the availability of meeting rooms in the county house in Trondheim.
As it was the first time I used PHP it was more of a learning project for me. However the site is still in use today after 2 years (as of January 2016).
